# count2branches 
Bayesian regressions of counts of positively selected genes (PSGs) as a function of branch lengths. Contact liliana.davalos@stonybrook.edu for any issues with the code and ariadna.morales@senckenberg.de for details on the data.
* To fit the models run count2branches_v2.R. The next two scripts require the RData output from count2branches_v2.R. 
* To print the results of the regressions run print_count2branches_v1.R. 
* To plot the resulting regressions, run plot_count2branches_v2.R.
