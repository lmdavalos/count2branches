# count2branches 
Bayesian regressions of counts of positively selected genes (PSGs) as a function of branch lengths. 
To fit the models run count2branches_v2.R. The next two scripts require the RData output from count2branches_v2.R. 
To print the results of the regressions run print_count2branches_v1.R. 
To plot the resulting regressions, run plot_count2branches_v2.R.
